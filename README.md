# Reaction Diffusion simulation

Playing with Gray-Scott 2D and 3D reaction diffusion in Unity

Pretty straight forward. Made a nice brush tool. Very similar to my old shader toy over here but with higher quality: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XslyD2

The rendering here is the interesting part. Didn't do anything too fancy but learned quite a few interesting details on direct volume visualization in the process.  
The brush tool here is pretty hard to use. VR controller might be nice here I guess.
